            To put it shortly, unicorns have changed me. <em>No, like seriously.</em> It's 
            been very healing for me to gain this fascination over unicorns. My 
            inner child is so delighted.

            A wonder I have is why aren't unicorns real? I mean, it's just a horse with a 
            horn (don't tell the unicorns that). We have a spotted horse with a neck double 
            its body height, why not just add the horn? Now that I'm putting it into words, 
            maybe they would be too powerful.

        <p>I'm going to list reasons why I personally think unicorns are amazing.
            <ol>
                <li>They could be real</li>
                <li>They are always pink (in my reality)</li>
                <li>They don't judge</li>
                <li>They are <strong>healing</strong></li>
            </ol>
